# Bouncing Ball Simulation using C

## introduction
- This project was my first project I did using C.
- At this point in time I was very less experienced with coding and didn't know what to google in order to make the things work the way I want to.

## project working
- I am using the console as a canvas for this project.
- The ball is created through drawing characters at the required place on the console.
- Used the simple equation of circle to draw the points.
- Update the parameters of the circle/ball accordingly to simulate gravity.
- The updation is done to the coordinate of the center of the circle.
- There is no damping simulated into the physics.

## conclusion
Maths can let us achieve interesting things even when our coding knowledge is limited.
