# Bouncing Ball Simulation using C
Projects i created while learning to code. All languages

# introduction
This project was my first project i did using C
At this point in time i was very less experienced with coding and didn't know what to google in order to make the things work the way i want to

# project working
I am using the console as a canvas for this project
The ball is created through drawing characters at the required place on the console
Used the simple equation of circle to draw the points
Update the parameters of the circle/ball accordingly to simulate gravity
The updation is done to the coordinate of the center of the circle
There is no damping simulated into the physics

# conclusion
Maths can let us achieve interesting things even when our coding knowledge is limited
